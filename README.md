# DailyPulse
A repository based on the classes by Petros Efthymiou on the course Kotlin Multiplatform Masterclass available on Udemy: https://www.udemy.com/course/kotlin-multiplatform-masterclass/

On this repository, there are examples of multiplatform development for Android and iOS using Kotlin Multiplatform, Koin, SQLDelight, Ktor, Clean Architecture, MVI, Jetpack Compose and SwiftUI. The architecture for it is closest to MVI.

This repository is not a clone of the instructor repository, but a handmade, step by step copy of it with some functionalities added. The original is available here: https://github.com/petros-efthymiou/DailyPulse
